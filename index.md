## Petriam

Petriam is a mobile application to serve the people with pets while they
are unable to take care of their pets during their time outside their homes. The
project aims to favor both sides of its target group which are hosts and clients.
Using Petriam, clients who are pet owners could list the possible temporary
homes for their pets while hosts who may or may not be pet owners can earn
money by taking care of the pets of their clients.
